# 🧠 NLP Practice – spaCy, BERT & Text Processing

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** playground, where I explore and apply a wide range of NLP concepts and techniques using Python tools like **spaCy**, **BERT**, **Gensim**, **fastText**, and more.  
This repository documents my hands-on journey as a Computer Engineering student passionate about AI and language understanding.
