# 🧠 NLP Practice – spaCy, BERT & Text Processing

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my first NLP repository, where I explore and apply various **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques using tools like **spaCy**, **BERT**, and Python libraries for text analysis.  
This project is part of my learning journey as an engineering student passionate about AI and language understanding.

## 🚀 What You’ll Find Here

- ✂️ Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- 🕵️ Named Entity Recognition with **spaCy**
- 🤖 Text classification with **BERT** and Transformers
- 📊 Exploratory analysis and basic NLP pipelines

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python  
- spaCy  
- Hugging Face Transformers (BERT)  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  


## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m **Othmane Abderrazik**, student in 4ᵉ year of Computer Engineering at **ENSA Marrakech**.  
I’m deeply interested in **AI**, **NLP**, and everything that brings machines closer to understanding human language. This repository is my first step toward mastering these tools.
